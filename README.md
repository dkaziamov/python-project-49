## About the Project

This project is a collection of interactive console-based mini-games designed to enhance logical thinking, math skills, and provide fun challenges. The project includes five core games:

### Core Games
1. Even or Odd (`brain_even`)  
   Determine whether a given number is even.
2. Calculator (`brain_calc`)  
   Solve a randomly generated mathematical expression.
3. Greatest Common Divisor (`brain_gcd`)  
   Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
4. Arithmetic Progression (`brain_progression`)  
   Identify the missing number in an arithmetic progression.
5. Prime Number (`brain_prime`)  
   Check whether a number is prime.

### Structure
Each game follows a unified structure:
- The user is presented with a task or question.
- The user provides an answer.
- The program validates the answer and provides feedback.
- A player wins by correctly answering a set number of questions in a row

### Utility Functions
The project also includes several utility functions to support the games, such as:
- Generating random numbers.
- Validating user input.
- Converting data types.
- Comparing answers and providing feedback.

These utility functions simplify the implementation and ensure consistency across the games, though they are secondary to the core gameplay.
